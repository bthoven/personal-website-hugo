I have spent most of my professional life doing scientific research in the fields of cosmology and condensed matter physics.

I started my academic life by achieving a bachelor's degree in condensed matter physics by the Federal University of Alagoas (Brazil) in 2007, where I investigated the unidimensional Anderson model with long-range correlated disorder.

Two years later, I received a master's degree in astronomy (2009) by the National Observatory (Brazil), working in cosmology by investigating the constraints of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect on the dark energy parameters.

My Ph.D. degree in astronomy was also provided by the National Observatory in 2013. As a PhD student, I studied the $f( R )$-gravity theories and its theoretical and observational aspects in the Palatini variational formalism.

I also spent 1 year, between 2013 and 2014, as a postdoctoral fellow at Mcgill University - Montreal, CA. At that time, my main task was to investigate the theoretical and observational aspects of cosmic string wakes in 21cm redshift surveys. After the time in McGill University, I came back to the National Observatory, also as a postdoctoral fellow, to continue my research in cosmology by doing a bunch of things mixing theory, observations and coding.

My contact with data science began when I was a master student. At that time, I was working on the interface between theory and astronomical observations, basically applying concepts of astrostatistics in my research. This kind of task has been my routine ever since.
